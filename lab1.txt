In the virtual environment, python 3 is set to the default python version.

environment, we can control certain factors exclusive to the venv (such as python

status code 200 is returned for http://www.google.com, but status code 
301 is returned for http://google.com (permanently moved).

curl -i http://google.com/teapot also returns a 301 (moved permanently to
http://www.google.com/teapot. This is returned by the -i and the -iL, though -iL will 
follow the redirection to the correct address and return the status code of it as well.
http://www.google.com/teapot has a status code of 418 I'm a Teapot.

In the first:

<H3>Form Contents:</H3>
<P>No form fields.
<DL>
</DL>

And in the second:

<H3>Form Contents:</H3>
<DL>
<DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
<DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
</DL>

By default, CURL sends a get request - in the second, we are sending a POST request instead.
This sends the "X=Y" assignment, which is then stored in the form.  The POST request is used 
to post, or send, form data to the target.
